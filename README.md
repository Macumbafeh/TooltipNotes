# TooltipNotes

###### Scary warning: Most of these addons were made long ago during Feenix days, then a lot was changed/added to prepare for Corecraft. Since it died, they still haven't been extensively tested on modern servers.

## Purpose:
This will collect the spells used by mobs and show them on their tooltip. Custom notes can also be set on them and on players.

## Using:
In the normal keybinding options under the "Tooltip Notes" section there are bindings that will set, show to yourself, or tell your group your target's notes. To remove a custom note but not spells, set a new, empty note.

| Commands | Description |
| --- | --- |
| /tnote set [name]       | _open the popup to set a custom note on [name] (or your target if [name] isn't used)_ |
| /tnote clear [name]     | _clear note/spells for [name] (or your target if [name] isn't used)_ |
| /tnote show [name]      | _show yourself the note/spells of [name] (or your target if [name] isn't used)_ |
| /tnote say [name]       | _tell your group the note/spells of [name] (or your target if [name] isn't used)_ |
| /tnote notecolor        | _set the text color of custom notes_ |
| /tnote spellcolor       | _set the text color of spells_ |
| /tnote&nbsp;wordwrap&nbsp;\<width> | _set how many characters to wrap notes at, or 0 for default -<br/>this should only be needed if you use certain tooltip addons_ |
